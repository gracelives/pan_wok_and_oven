Data 198: Applied Data Science for Research and Discovery

Data 198 is an off-ramp for students who wat to learn more about research methods after taking [Data 8](https://data8.org), but don't nessecarily want to take an upper div data science course. This repository is for the [Data 198 website](https://ds-modules.github.io/DATA198-SP21.github.io/).

<!--

The UC Berkeley Foundations of Data Science course combines three perspectives:
inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given
data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so
as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and
skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with
hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document
collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social
issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design.

-->

The course is offered in partnership with the [Berkeley Division of Data Sciences](http://data.berkeley.edu).
