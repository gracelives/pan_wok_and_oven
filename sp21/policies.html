    <h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>This course aims to build a bridge between the Data 8 curriculum and hands-on data science. Intended for students who have just completed Data 8 and plan to study fields that involve working with data, the course will translate knowledge of the datascience package to the pandas library, and give students supplemental technical skills to support their own data analysis projects. Data science methods such as finding robust datasets, dealing with missing values, and assessing the validity of the analysis will be taught. By the end of the semester, students will have carried out a start-to-finish analysis of data of their choosing.  Upon completing this course, students will be able to use industry-grade data science tools to analyze data for projects in all fields. </p>


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Students should have completed Data 8 before taking this course.  It is also recommended, but not required, that students have taken a linear algebra course such as Math 54.</p>


<!-- <h3>Support</h3>
<p>You are not alone in this course; the staff and instructors are here to support you as you learn the material. It's expected that some aspects of the course will take time to master, and the best way to master challenging material is to ask questions. For online questions, use <a href="https://piazza.com/berkeley/fall2019/data88">Piazza</a>. We will also hold office hours for in-person discussions.</p>

<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<p>Dr. Van Dusen holds office hours on Thursdays from 11am to 12pm in Hearst Field Annex B64. The Connector Assistants hold office hours on Mondays from 2pm to 4pm in TBD. You are welcome to show up to any office hours.</p>

-->
          
          
<!--
<h3>Waitlisted Students</h3>
<p>If you are on the waiting list, you must still do all coursework and complete labs and homework by the deadlines.  We will not be offering extensions if you are admitted into the course later. So it is your responsibility to stay up to date on the assignments.</p>
<p>You are welcome to attend lecture and lab while you are on the waiting list. Rooms may feel a little crowded in the first week.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, doing all the work is not a guarantee of enrollment. You will only be enrolled if there is space in your lab. Enrollment will proceed by CalCentral.</p>
<p>If you add the course after Week 1, you must contact your assigned Lab TA (see Staff Page) by email as soon as you add the course. The email must include your full name, Student ID number, date you added the course, and your @berkeley.edu email address. </p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The rest of this page details the policies that will be enforced in the Summer 2019 offering of this course. These policies are subject to change until the beginning of the semester and throughout the remainder of the course, at the judgement of the course staff. </p>
-->
          
<h3>Lectures</h3>
<p>Lectures will consist of two segments: a pre-recorded set of youtube videos to be watched at home with a follow-along Jupyter Notebook, and a live, synchronous lecture. They are designed to work hand in hand and one is not a substitute for the other. Live lectures will be during the scheduled class time of Mondays from 5:00 - 6:00 PM PST, and will occasionally feature guest lecturers from the data science industry. They will <strong>NOT be recorded</strong> and <strong>attendance will be taken.</strong></p>

<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>The class will be run as much like a seminar as a regular class. Your participation is necessary to make this work. We will be expecting you to discuss during class, participate on Piazza, and come to Office Hours. You are required to check in with the course staff team for at least once during the semester.  We also need your feedback on our materials  in order to improve them! </p>
<p>If you are unable to attend class, email the instructor to have your absence excused <strong>24 hours before the lecture</strong>. Students are allowed 2 excused absences during the semester. If you are unable to attend lecture without notice, please post privately on Piazza so that the course staff are aware. </p>
<p>Participation will be graded based on attendance and overall interaction with other students and course staff. As mentioned above, attendance will be taken during lecture, and students will be awarded full participation credit for attending at least 7/12 of live lectures and checking in with a course staff member before and after the final project. This will be worth 20% of the final course grade. </p>
          
<h3>Labs</h3>
<p>Labs are designed to help you gain familiarity and practice the new concepts taught in lecture. They are to be completed individually and then reviewed together as a group. There will be three labs throughout the course, and each will be worth 10% of the final course grade.</p>
          
<h3>Final Project</h3>                   
<p>The final project will be a culmination of everything taught in the class, going through the entire data science lifecycle. It will be worth 50% of the final course grade.</p>
<p>For more information on the project, check out the<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j24HBcrDa9J18EaTMSIAuzAtxB2w4wI_oFZmhqb0eic/edit?usp=sharing/"> prompt & rubric </a>and<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OqHk6P8qUx9rOe4Av_JlQ-gv_zk550f_elJjKjL4UgA/edit?usp=sharing/"> example datasets & projects </a>under the Resources tab of the navigation bar.</p>
          
<h3>Grades</h3>
<p>Grades will be assigned using the following weighted components:</p>
<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;width:25%;}
.tg td{padding:4px 4px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{padding:4px 4px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}
</style>

<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">Activity</th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">Grade</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Participation</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">20%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Labs</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">30%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Project</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">50%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p> This class will only be offered for P/NP credit.  To earn a passing grade, students must earn at least 70% of the total points offered.  </p>
         


          
<!--<h3>Extra Credit</h3>
<p>We will offer two opportunities for extra credit. These assignments will involve reading a paper, listening to a podcast, etc. and writing a 500-word reflection on it. Each of these will serve to replace 2.5% of your grade in your lowest category, offering a total of 5% extra credit. These will be calculated at the end of the course.</p>

<h3>Late Policy & Regrades</h3>
<p>Students are allowed to submit assignments late for a 50% penalty until the Wednesday after it is due at 11:59 PM, after which they will receive no credit. Scores for assignments will be released Monday nights and the corresponding regrade requests will be due on Wednesdays at 11:59 PM for all assignments.</p>

<h3>Learning Cooperatively</h3>
<p>We encourage you to discuss course content with your friends and classmates as you are working on your weekly assignments. No matter what your academic background, you will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.</p>

-->

<!--          
<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>You must write your answers in your own words, and you must not share your completed work.</p>
<p>Make a serious attempt at every assignment yourself. If you get stuck, read the supporting code and lab discussion. After that, go ahead and discuss any remaining doubts with others, especially the course staff. That way you will get the most out of the discussion.</p>
<p>You are also not permitted to turn in answers or code that you have obtained from others. Not only is such copying dishonest, it misses the point of the assignments, which is not for you to find the answers somewhere and send them along to the staff. It is for you to figure out how to solve the problems, with the support available in the course.</p>
<p>Please read Berkeley's <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> carefully. Penalties for cheating at UC Berkeley are severe and include reporting to the <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct">Center for Student Conduct</a>. They might also include a F in the course or even dismissal from the university. It's just not worth it.</p>
<p>Go on Piazza and discuss with other students or the CAs.   We expect that you will work with integrity and with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staff will work with integrity and with respect for you.</p>
